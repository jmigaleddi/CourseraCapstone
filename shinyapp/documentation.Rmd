#### Introduction
The task of this project was to perform analysis on a set of text data, with the ultimate goal of creating a Shiny application that would utilize a language model to generate next-word predictions based on user input.     

The data used for the project were provided by SwiftKey and consisted of a corpus of Twitter posts, blog posts, and news stories.   

In order to achieve the task of next-word prediction, an *n-gram* language model was constructed. Document-feature matrices with up to _**4-grams**_ were created and manipulated, and **Stupid Backoff** was used to account for user input that was not seen in the training data.   

In order to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the n-gram model, a benchmarking algorithm was used (the algorithm and supporting documentation can be found [on Github](https://github.com/hfoffani/dsci-benchmark). This model achieved a 5.46% top-1 precision and 10.86% top-3 precision. The average runtime was 120.74 msec, and the total memory used was 132.6MB.   

The Shiny application can be found [here](https://jmigaleddi.shinyapps.io/NextWordPrediction/).     
     
     
#### Exploratory
Prior to language modeling, some exploratory analysis was performed on the data in order to get a feel for the data.

```{r basic summaries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
cnxn.twit <-                    file(description = "C:/Users/migalej/OneDrive for Business/OnlineEducation/DataScienceSpecialization/10-Capstone/courseprojects/data/final/en_US/en_US.twitter.txt", open = "r")
twitter <-                      readLines(cnxn.twit)
close.connection(cnxn.twit)

cnxn.news <-                    file(description = "C:/Users/migalej/OneDrive for Business/OnlineEducation/DataScienceSpecialization/10-Capstone/courseprojects/data/final/en_US/en_US.newsEDIT.txt", open = "r")
news <-                         readLines(cnxn.news)
close.connection(cnxn.news)

cnxn.blogs <-                   file(description = "C:/Users/migalej/OneDrive for Business/OnlineEducation/DataScienceSpecialization/10-Capstone/courseprojects/data/final/en_US/en_US.blogs.txt", open = "r")
blogs <-                        readLines(cnxn.blogs)
close.connection(cnxn.blogs)

twitlines <-                    length(twitter)
avgtwitlinelength <-            round(mean(sapply(twitter, nchar), na.rm = T))
newslines <-                    length(news)
avgnewslinelength <-            round(mean(sapply(news, nchar), na.rm = T))
blogslines <-                   length(blogs)
avgblogslinelength <-           round(mean(sapply(blogs, nchar), na.rm = T))

initial.table <- rbind(cbind(twitlines, avgtwitlinelength, twitlines * avgtwitlinelength), 
                       cbind(newslines, avgnewslinelength, newslines * avgnewslinelength), 
                       cbind(blogslines, avgblogslinelength, blogslines * avgblogslinelength))
rownames(initial.table) <- c("Twitter", "News", "Blogs")
colnames(initial.table) <- c("# of Lines", "Avg Line Length", "# of Characters")

print(initial.table)
```

In total, the English-language data set is very large (nearly 4.2 million lines in total). Given the large volume, a random sample will be utilized for further analysis. The benefits gained in processing time will outweigh any degradation in the analysis due to removing a large number of our observations. Specifically, a random sample of 10% will be used for modeling phase utilizing the `rbinom` function with a 0.10 probability to create a sampling index and filter the original data set.
     
     
#### Pre-Processing and Modeling
Prior to modeling, a few cleaning steps were used in order to remove unwanted characters from the data. Specifically, the `gsub` function was used to remove anything that wasn't alphanumeric, a space, or punctuation (these would ultimately be handled by the `dfm` function in the `quanteda` package.) In addition, apostrophes were removed, as well as strings of consecutive underscores and dashes.

Post-processing, document-feature matrices (DFMs) were created (up to *4-grams*). For each DFM, the following steps were taken:   

1. Calculate column sums (in order to determine word counts)
2. Clean the column names
3. Calculate transform the *n-gram* into its components for the purposes of calculating the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE)
4. Create the "prefix" and "predicted word" fields, i.e. for *3-grams*, split the *3-gram* into three words, and concatenate the first two for the prefix
5. Join the current table with the *n-1-gram* table for the purposes of calculating the MLE
6. Clean the column names
7. Calculate the MLE
     
Once the tables were created, focus could then shift to creating a function which would generate next-word predictions. The function takes up to three words as input (as well as an optional argument for the amount of results to return) and generates a data table with 4 fields:

1. **"input"** -        the components of the user input that were used to generate the prediction
2. **"source"** -       the model that was used, i.e. *4-gram*, *3-gram*, etc.
3. **"prediction"** -   the next-word prediction
4. **"score"** -        the score generated through implementation of Stupid Backoff

Some clarification on the "score" field: in order to account for instances of user input which haven't been seen in the training data, some sort of smoothing methodology must be implemented. In this case, a version of backoff methodology called Stupid Backoff was used. What this does is if the highest order of user input (in this case *3-grams*) cannot be found in the training data, the model "backs off" to the next lowest-order *n-gram* (in this case the *2-gram*). In order to downweight the importance of the lower-order *n-gram* model, a parameter *alpha* is applied to the MLEs calculated in each *n-gram* model. As each "backoff" happens, the *alpha* parameter is raised to an additional power, e.g. 1 backoff results in *alpha*^1^, 2 backoffs results in *alpha*^2^, etc. In the Stupid Backoff, the *alpha* parameter is set to 0.4. The "score" field is the result of this backoff calculation.

In the event that the user input cannot be found in the training data, the most commonly used unigrams are returned.
     
#### Model Evaluation
As stated in the introduction, a benchmarking script was available via Github from previous students in the Data Science Specialization Capstone. Running the prediction function through the algorithm yielded the following results:

```Overall top-3 score:     8.04 %```   
```Overall top-1 precision: 5.46 %```   
```Overall top-3 precision: 10.86 %```   
```Average runtime:         120.74 msec```   
```Number of predictions:   28103```   
```Total memory used:       132.60 MB```   

```Dataset details```   
 ```Dataset "blogs" (599 lines, 14437 words, hash 871ff13e0a82611957f43158c5511de5e4f0dfe121fd674888d865dbe390cb96)```   
  ```Score: 6.91 %, Top-1 precision: 3.53 %, Top-3 precision: 11.03 %```   
 ```Dataset "tweets" (793 lines, 13894 words, hash 7571053d5534e9e9e6e6391176e0dd83bedb1227e86cb220bca59c95286fa6d1)```   
  ```Score: 9.17 %, Top-1 precision: 7.40 %, Top-3 precision: 10.69 %```   

While the prediction accuracy results are admittedly mediocre, these were the best results after performing multiple experiments with different sample sizes, different pre-processing steps, etc. These results are being shared as it is critical for users to know the performance they can expect when using the app to predict words.     

For reference, it has been anecdotally quoted that the actual SwiftKey mobile app has top-3 precision of about 30%.
